% In some reactions some species present as reactant and product. 
% For e.g., A + B -> A + C. where A is a reactant and a product. 
% Net gain of A is zero molecules. This will remove A from original 
% Stoichiometry matrix and cannot idnetify the reactants properly which is
% necassary for computing reaction propensities in CME

% The following function will generate an array of 'Reaction_rates'.
% However, when the 'Reaction_rates' are changing with respect to the
% current population of species, edit the following function accordingly.
% Leave it commented if the rates are constants as before.

% Rate = Reaction_rate_Function(Reaction_rates,S);

%% Initial molecular population
Initial_Molecular_Population=[1e2, 5e1, 0, 0];

%% Boundary condtion on molecular population of each species for open systems
% In an open system, there will be species with unbounded population.
% If there exists a conservation of some species, they will be aleady
% bounded. For unconserved species, the upper bound values should be
% defined so that a finite CME can be generated. (Default) boundary
% condition is set to 10 molecules each for (unconserved) species.
% Conserved species will accept values irrespective of the input

Boundary_condition=[10, 10, 10, 10];

%% Conservation Laws
% Keep this untouched as long as the conservation law identified from rref has
% integer values. Otherwise, modify manually with integer conservation
% values. First identify conservation law by running (uncomment the following line)

% Conservation = Conservation_Law (Stoichiometry)

% Scale the result so that all columns have integer values.
