%% Upper bound of molecular population of each species
% for a closed system, depending upon the conservation law and 
% initial molecular population, there is an upper bound on each species. 
% In open systems, we need to define the upper bound explicitely for
% generating a finite CME. For closed system algorithm  will automatically
% define the upper bopund of each species.

% While using combvec, we have to keep the vectors generated using combvec
% less exploding. In every iteration, we will generate a set 
% of column vectors using combvec and then remove some rows which are 
% not satisfying the conservation laws. If the first vectors are large 
% enough, then by iteratively removing the rows using conservation, 
% the newer vectors formed with olde combvec output will be less expoloding. 
% The following re-indexing will help it.

% In a biochemical system depending upon the initial molecular population,
% dimension of the system varies. However, we can generate a mimal CME so
% that each species will take part in at least one of the reaction 
% using a smaller amount of initial molecular population. 
% The floowing lines does this job by idetifying the species which are 
% neccessary for this to happen.
