function [Index] = Combvec_Optimization_index(Conservation,UB)
%% While using combvec, we have to keep th%e vectors generated using combvec
% less exploding. In every iteration, we will generate a set 
% of column vectors using combvec and then remove some rows which are 
% not satisfying the conservation laws. If the first vectors are large 
% enough, then by iteratively removing the rows using conservation, 
% the newer vectors formed with olde combvec output will be less expoloding. 
% The following re-indexing will help it.

% Identify and remove the dependent sepcies
